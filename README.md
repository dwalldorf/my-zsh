# README
This is just a repo to keep my zsh config synchronized

If you want to, you can use and modify it but it's nothing special going on here ;)

# How to use it
Clone this repository to your home directory and rename the folder to `.my-zsh`.

Delete everything from your `~/.zprofile` and add `source ~/.my-zsh/zprofile.zsh`. That's it.
