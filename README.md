# README
This is just a repo to keep my zsh config synchronized

If you want to, you can use and modify it but it's nothing special going on here ;)

# How to use it
Clone this repository:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/dwalldorf/my-zsh ~/.my-zsh

Delete everything from your `~/.zprofile` and add `source ~/.my-zsh/zprofile.zsh`. That's it.

If you want to, you can create a file `custom` in your clone directory which will be ignored by git but sourced automatically if it exists.
